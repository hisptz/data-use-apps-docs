It provides a description of the actions required to address a specific problem, states the period within which this action should be done, responsible person, status of completion, review date and provides for any review notes.

### Action Description

This field (see Figure 2.1-C above) allows you to describe in detail the specific actions that will be taken to arrive at the proposed solution. The action recorded should be clear and specific. Only one action should be recorded and in case the proposed solution requires more than one, then another action is recorded as indicated in 2.1.B above.

### Start Date and End Date

These fields  (see Figure 2.1-C above) are for the period over which it is anticipated that the action will be performed.

### Responsible Person and Designation Title

These fields ((see Figure 2.1-C above) allow you to record the person who will be responsible for this action and their designation. This is important for follow up and progress of execution of the action.

### Budget

This field allows you to record the amount of money that has been allocated to execute the action.

### BNA Target

This field allows you to record the desired value to be attained by this indicator over a given period.  This should not be an arbitrary figure, however, it should be derived from approved program targets that were set by the respective program.

Once all the fields on  Figure 2.1-C above  have been filled, click on “update” to save the information in the action tracker.
