# General Configuration

The general configuration allows you to configure basic details of the application. This is the basic metadata
information that is required to define how the application will work with organisation units, periods, and users of the
system

## Organisation Units

The Standalone Action Tracker application is designed to work with the existing organisation units in the DHIS2 system.

### Organisation Unit Access

The Standalone Action Tracker data model needs to be configured to allow access to organisation units. The configuration
can allow access to all organisation units or only those that apply to the use case. The application will only allow to
plan and track for the organisation units that are selected.

You can change the access at any time, but it is recommended to change it before you start planning as it may cause some
inconsistencies in data analysis.

The organisation selection is similar to the organisation selection in the Maintenance application. To select a one or
more
organisation unit, click on the organisation unit name and the selection should be checked.

hand side of the selector and click on 'Select'. You can also deselect organisation units on a specific level by
clicking on 'Deselect'

### Planning Organisation Unit Level

You can configure planning and tracking to be limited to only some of the organisation unit levels. This means the
organisation unit selectors will be limited to only organisation units in this level

To enable, click on the checkbox and then select an organisation unit level in the select field

To disable this feature. uncheck the checkbox. With the checkbox unchecked, organisation unit selectors will allow
selection for all organisation units

### Default Organisation Unit

The default organisation unit allows you to set a pre-selected organisation unit which will be automatically selected
when the application is opened.

Click on the button and a popup with accessible organisation units will appear. Select the organisation unit you would
like to select and click on 'Select'
