Once done your application will be ready to use.

If you opt to start fresh, you will need to create a new configuration.

## New Setup

To setup a new configuration, you have to decide on the level of categorization you want to use. The Standalone Action
Tracker supports 3 levels of categorization.
In future versions, there will be support for Bottleneck Analysis planning.

- **Basic activity tracking**: The basic activity tracking is the most basic level of categorization. In this setup, the
  actions are only categorized once without any nested categories.

- **Secondary activity tracking**: The secondary activity tracking is a more advanced level of categorization. In this
  setup, the actions are categorized twice (one nested category).

- **Tertiary activity tracking**: The tertiary activity tracking is the most advanced level of categorization. In this
  setup, the actions are categorized three (two nested categories).

It is important to understand which of these level of categorization is the best fit for your use case before starting
to setup your standalone action tracker. Selecting a level of categorization cannot be changed at a later time.
