# Introduction

## Overview

The Standalone Action Tracker is a DHIS2 custom application designed to help teams plan, coordinate, and follow through
on priority actions within DHIS2. Whether you are running a performance improvement cycle, coordinating implementation
activities, or managing follow‑up tasks from review meetings, the app provides a simple, structured workspace to capture
actions, assign responsibility, set timelines, and monitor progress to completion.

At its core, the app brings together planning, categorization, and reporting so that programs can move from decisions to
results. Users can define goals, break them down into activities, and track progress using an intuitive interface that
adapts to local terminology and workflows. Because it runs inside DHIS2, actions stay connected to the data and
organizational context you already use every day.

## Key features

- Up to three levels of categorization of activities
    - Organize actions by up to three hierarchical levels (for example: Strategic Area → Intervention → Activity). This helps teams filter, group, and report on actions in ways that mirror their program structure.
    - Use categories to focus reviews (e.g., by program area or technical domain) and to quickly identify gaps or overlaps.

- Customizable labels, workflows, and interface
    - Rename key terms (e.g., “Action,” “Owner,” “Due date”) to match your local vocabulary.
    - Configure status/stage labels to reflect your workflow (e.g., Planned → In progress → Completed → Verified).
    - Tailor list columns and forms to emphasize what matters most to your users.

- Planning of activities support
    - Create actions with clear objectives, owners, start/end dates, and priority.
    - Optionally set targets or milestones so that plans are measurable and time‑bound.
    - Add implementation context such as location (org unit), funding source, and related program indicators when relevant.

- Assignment and ownership
    - Assign a clear “owner” and contributors to each action. Ownership helps drive accountability during follow‑up.
    - Filter and report by owner, team, or org unit to prepare review meeting updates.

- Progress tracking, updates, and evidence
    - Update status as work progresses and capture narrative updates, blockers, and next steps.
    - Attach links or references to evidence (e.g., documents or DHIS2 resources) to support verification.
    - View a history of changes to understand how an action evolved over time.

- Reporting, filtering, and export
    - Generate summaries by category, status, owner, or time period to support review meetings and supervision visits.
    - Powerful filters and search help you focus on specific priorities (e.g., overdue, high‑priority, specific district).
    - Export lists for sharing or offline review (e.g., CSV/Excel) and use outputs to feed meeting minutes.

- Works within DHIS2
    - Authenticate with your existing DHIS2 user accounts and respect user roles and org unit hierarchies.
    - Link actions to the DHIS2 context you already use—reducing duplication and keeping everything in one place.
    - Benefit from localization and familiar navigation for DHIS2 users.
