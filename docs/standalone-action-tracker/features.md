# Features

## Overview

The Standalone Action Tracker comes with a number of features that can help you move from decisions to results.

Some of the key features include:

- Three-level categorization to mirror your program structure
- Customizable labels, statuses, and interface
- Planning support with clear objectives, owners, and timelines
- Ownership and assignment to drive accountability
- Progress updates with history and evidence
- Reporting, filtering, and export for reviews and supervision
- Seamless operation inside DHIS2 (auth, org units, roles)

## Categorize actions with up to three levels

Structure your actions to match how your program works. You can define up to three hierarchical levels, for example:

- Strategic Area → Intervention → Activity
- Pillar → Workstream → Task
- Actions

This setup allows you to tailor the app to work with your existing program structure.

Why it helps:

- Filter and group actions during review meetings by theme or program area.
- Quickly spot gaps, overlaps, or overloaded workstreams.
- Produce summaries that match how your teams report.

## Customize labels and workflow

Adapt the app to your local terminology and process so users feel at home:

- Rename key terms (for example: Action, Owner, Due date) to your preferred vocabulary.
- Configure the status flow to reflect your reality (e.g., Planned → In progress → Completed → Verified).
- Choose which fields appear in lists and forms to highlight what matters most.

Benefits:

- Faster onboarding and less confusion for users with established terms.
- Consistent status language across teams and meetings.

## Plan actions clearly

Create actionable, time‑bound plans:

- Define clear objectives, owners, start/end dates, and priority.
- Optionally set targets or milestones to make progress measurable.
- Add context like organization unit (location), funding source, or related indicators when relevant.

Outcomes:

- Better prepared implementation plans and easier follow‑through.
- Shared understanding of what “done” looks like.

## Track progress and attach evidence

Keep everyone aligned as work advances:

- Update status as work progresses and capture narrative updates, blockers, and next steps.
- Link to evidence (documents, files) to support verification.
- Review the history of changes to see how an action evolved.

## Report, filter, and export

Turn action lists into decision‑ready summaries:

- Filter by category, status, owner, org unit, or time period.
- Focus on priorities such as overdue or high‑priority items.
- Export to CSV/Excel for sharing, archiving, or integrating into meeting minutes.

## Built for DHIS2

The app works natively within DHIS2, so your actions live in the same context as your data:

- Authenticate with existing DHIS2 users and respect roles and org‑unit hierarchies.
- Link to locations and program context you already manage in DHIS2.
- Benefit from localization and familiar navigation for DHIS2 users.
