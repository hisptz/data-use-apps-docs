# Overview
The Data Use Applications (Data Use Apps) are a suite of interconnected DHIS2 applications designed to strengthen data analysis, evidence based, informed decision making, and action planning across health and development programs. Developed collaboratively by **UNICEF**, **the University of Oslo (UiO)**, **HISP Uganda**, and **HISP Tanzania**, these apps empower stakeholders at all levels from national program leads to district managers and facility teams, to translate routine data into meaningful insights and tangible improvements in service delivery.

## What Are Data Use Apps?
Data Use Apps are lightweight, modular DHIS2 applications focused on making data easy to interpret, actionable, and results oriented. They bring together essential tools for:
- Monitoring and tracking key performance indicators
- Identifying bottlenecks in service delivery
- Understanding root causes of performance gaps
- Planning and tracking interventions and activities
- Strengthening accountability and follow up mechanisms

Together, these applications create a streamlined workflow from **data** → **insight** → **action** → **follow up**, enabling continuous improvement cycles within health systems.

## Purpose of Data Use Apps

The primary purpose of the Data Use Apps is to close the gap between data collection and data use. While DHIS2 provides powerful data collection and reporting capabilities, many programs struggle with:
- Identifying gaps and bottlenecks affecting performance
- Coordinating follow up actions
- Tracking the implementation and impact of those actions

Data Use Apps simplify this process by giving users intuitive tools that help them:
- Review performance quickly using visual scorecards
- Detect bottlenecks through structured analysis using the Tanahashi model
- Identify root causes of poor performance
- Plan actions based on evidence
- Track progress on planned actions to ensure accountability and results

## Overall Vision
The vision of the Data Use Apps ecosystem is to build a culture of data use at all levels of the health system, where decisions are guided by evidence, resources are allocated strategically, and actions are monitored for results.

The long term goal is to provide a unified set of tools that:
- Enhance data driven planning and informed decision making
- Improve the quality and coverage of essential services
- Strengthen local and national accountability
- Support performance improvement across key indicators
- Enable governments and partners to achieve better outcomes for women, children, and vulnerable populations

By integrating analysis, diagnosis, planning, and monitoring into a single workflow, the Data Use Apps help institutions move from reactive reporting to proactive, evidence driven program management.

## Components of the Data Use Apps Suite
The suite currently consists of four core applications, each addressing a different stage of the data use cycle:
### Scorecard App
Provides a quick, visual way to track and compare the performance of key indicators. Color coding helps users immediately see where performance is strong, needs attention, or requires urgent action.

### Bottleneck Analysis (BNA) App
Helps users identify barriers affecting service delivery using the Tanahashi model (availability, accessibility, acceptability, contact, and quality). Users can analyze gaps and determine root causes of poor performance.

### BNA Linked Action Tracker
A dedicated tool that connects bottleneck and root cause findings to concrete actions. Users can plan, assign, and monitor activities directly linked to BNA results.

### Standalone Action Tracker (SAT)
A flexible app for teams that need an independent action-tracking workflow. It supports planning, coordination, and follow-up on priority actions, even beyond BNA processes.
