# Ecosystem overview

## How the Data Use Apps Work Together

The Data Use Apps are designed not as standalone tools, but as an integrated data-to-action ecosystem. Each app plays a unique role in the decision making cycle, creating a continuous loop from performance monitoring to action follow up. Together, they enable programs to move from identifying problems to implementing and tracking solutions within a single, unified workflow.

## The Data Use Apps Workflow
At the core of the ecosystem is a four-step process:
- Review & Interpret Performance (Scorecard App)
- Identify Bottlenecks & Diagnose Causes (BNA App)
- Plan & Assign Actions (Linked Action Tracker)
- Track Implementation & Accountability (Standalone or Linked AT)

This workflow ensures that data is not only analyzed but systematically used to improve services.

## How the Four Apps Connect
Below is the flow of interaction among the data use apps:

### Scorecard → BNA
Users begin by reviewing performance indicators in the Scorecard App.
If an indicator performs poorly (e.g., marked red or yellow), they can launch a Bottleneck Analysis to investigate further.
#### Purpose:
- Identify what is underperforming
- Move to understanding why it’s underperforming

### BNA → Root Cause Analysis

Within the BNA App, users evaluate performance through the Tanahashi model to identify the specific stage (availability, accessibility, acceptability, contact, quality) where the bottleneck exists.
From there, users perform root cause analysis (e.g., using the 5 Whys).
#### Outcome:
A list of bottlenecks and root causes that require action.

### BNA → Linked Action Tracker
Once bottlenecks and root causes are identified, users can seamlessly send them to the Linked Action Tracker.
#### Purpose:
- Create action plans
- Assign responsibilities
- Set timelines
- Link actions directly to BNA findings

This ensures transparent follow up on the exact gaps identified through analysis.

### Action Tracker (Standalone or Linked) → Implementation & Monitoring
Teams use the Action Tracker to:
- Track progress of planned activities
- Update status (in progress, completed, delayed)
- Document evidence
- Communicate responsibilities

The Action Tracker creates organizational accountability and closes the loop between data insights and real-world actions.

### Feedback Loop to Scorecard
As actions are implemented and data is updated in DHIS2:
- Improved performance becomes visible again in the Scorecard App
- Managers can verify whether actions had the expected impact
- If gaps persist, the cycle continues

This supports a continuous quality improvement cycle.

## Why the Ecosystem Matters
- Ensures end to end data use, not just analysis
- Creates a structured method to identify and fix performance gaps
- Links **evidence** → **action** → *accountability*
- Reduces fragmentation between planning tools
- Strengthens program management and improves outcomes
