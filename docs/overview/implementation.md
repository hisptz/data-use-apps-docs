# Implementation Framework
The implementation of the Data Use Apps requires a combination of technical setup, stakeholder engagement, and governance alignment. This section provides a high level guide to help countries, programs, and implementing partners adopt and operationalize the full Data Use Apps ecosystem successfully.

## Prerequisites
Before deploying the Data Use Apps, ensure the following technical and organizational prerequisites are in place:

### DHIS2 Platform Requirements
- DHIS2 version 2.39 or higher (recommended: latest stable version)
- Proper configuration of:
    - Data elements and indicators
    - Data sets or program indicators
    - Organizational hierarchy
    - User roles and sharing settings
- Functional analytics and data approvals where applicable

### Data Availability & Quality
The apps rely on timely and accurate data. Implementers should confirm:
- Routine data reporting is consistent
- Indicator formulas are correct and validated
- Data quality checks (DQAs) are conducted regularly
- Domains used in scorecards and BNA are populated with real data

### Infrastructure & Access
- Stable server hosting environment
- Reliable internet connectivity for end users
- User accounts with appropriate permissions (analysis, dashboards, apps)
- Access to the DHIS2 App Hub or ability to deploy custom apps

## Implementation Governance
Successful adoption requires strong governance structures to ensure ownership, sustainability, and alignment with national systems and guidelines.

### Leadership & Coordination
Countries should designate:
- A national coordinating team (MoH, implementing partners)
- A technical working group (TWG) for M&E or Digital Health
- A dedicated Data Use Task Team at subnational levels

These teams guide adoption, review progress, and ensure integration into existing planning processes.

### Integration With National Processes
The Data Use Apps must align with:
- Annual or quarterly performance reviews
- National health sector planning cycles
- RMNCAH, Nutrition, Immunization, HIV, or other program reviews
- Joint supervision and mentorship structures

Ensuring integration increases sustainability and reduces parallel processes.

### Roles & Responsibilities
Clear roles should be defined for:
- Ministry of Health / Program Units: Ownership, policy direction
- **District Teams**: Data review, bottleneck analysis, action follow-up
- **Facility Teams**: Data entry and local improvement actions
- **HISP Teams**: Technical configuration, user training, support
- **Partners (UNICEF, NGOs)**: Capacity building and supervision support


## Adoption Steps (High-Level Guide)
### Orientation & Stakeholder Buy-In
Introduce the role of the apps in enhancing data to action processes. Facilitate sessions with national and subnational leaders to build understanding and commitment.

### System Readiness Assessment
Evaluate:
- Data quality and availability
- Existing scorecards
- Completeness of indicator metadata
- Alignment with program needs

This ensures the tools are adopted on a solid baseline.

### Technical Deployment
- Install required applications (Scorecard, BNA, Linked AT, SAT)
- Configure indicator groups, domains, BNA models, and action categories
- Validate user roles and sharing permissions
- Test end to end workflows in a testing environment

### Capacity Building
Develop a training plan tailored for:
- National program managers
- Regional/district data teams
- Facility-level staff

Training should include practical exercises using real program data.

### Pilot Implementation
Run a pilot in selected regions or districts to:
- Test workflows
- Validate indicators and BNA models
- Train action planning teams
- Identify user challenges and refine configurations

### Scale Up & Institutionalization
Once validated:
- Roll out to more regions/districts
- Embed workflows into quarterly review meetings
- Use AT to track follow ups of RMNCAH/immunization/nutrition actions
- Monitor usage and impact via dashboards

### Continuous Improvement
Use insights from pilot and rollout to:
- Update scorecard indicator sets
- Refine bottleneck models
- Improve action tracking categories
- Strengthen data quality interventions

This ensures the ecosystem evolves with program needs.

## Data Governance & Accountability
To ensure long term sustainability, programs should establish:

### Data Governance Framework
- Policies for indicator updates and reviews
- Data validation and quality assurance processes
- Clear naming and metadata standards
- Approval processes for changes in scorecards or BNA models

### Action Accountability Mechanism
An established workflow where:
- Actions are reviewed during routine review meetings
- Progress status is updated in Action Tracker
- Leaders provide feedback and support
- Completed actions feed back into performance improvement

This reinforces a culture of data use and results-based management.

## Recommended Best Practices
- **Start simple**: begin with a small set of priority indicators
- Use real data during trainings
- Avoid overly complex scorecard domains
- Limit the number of bottleneck questions to essential ones
- Assign clear owners for each action
- Review action progress monthly or quarterly
- Ensure digital and non digital processes align
