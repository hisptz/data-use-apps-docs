# Introduction

## What is Scorecard App?
The Scorecard App is an interactive application within DHIS2 designed to track, visualize, and review key performance indicators. It provides health managers and program teams with an intuitive way to monitor progress, identify performance gaps, and take informed action.

Unlike raw data tables or complex analytics, the Scorecard App presents information in a simple, color-coded scorecard format that makes it easier for users at all levels to interpret results and engage in meaningful discussions. It supports the **Plan** → **Monitor** → **Review** → **Act** cycle by linking data directly to decision-making and follow-up actions.

## Audience/Targets
The Scorecard App is designed for a wide range of health system users, including:
- **Program managers**, Who require quick, consolidated views of program performance across multiple indicators.
- **Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) officers**, who compile and interpret data to support reporting and program reviews.
- **Decision-makers at facility, district, regional, and national levels**  who rely on visual, easy-to-interpret dashboards for planning, accountability, and resource allocation.
- **Partners and stakeholders** including donors and technical partners who monitor progress towards set targets.
- **Frontline health workers and supervisors** who need actionable insights to guide routine service delivery and performance improvements.

## Purpose: Why Scorecard?
The Scorecard App addresses a critical gap between data availability and data use. While DHIS2 provides robust data collection and storage, not all health managers or program staff have advanced analytical skills to generate meaningful insights. The Scorecard App bridges this gap by offering:
- Simplified visualization of indicators through easy-to-read scorecards.
- Automated analysis outputs that reduce the need for complex statistical knowledge.
- Color coded results (**Green** = good, **Yellow** = caution, **Red** = underperforming) that immediately highlight areas requiring attention.
- Support for routine decision-making during review meetings at different levels of the health system.
- Enhanced accountability and transparency, since performance data can be easily shared and interpreted across stakeholders.
- Promotion of a data-use culture, ensuring data does not remain static but directly informs planning, monitoring, and corrective action.
> In essence, the Scorecard App empowers managers and teams to move from data collection to action, enabling continuous improvement in health program performance

## How can it be used?
The Scorecard App offers flexibility in how it can be deployed and accessed:
- As a standalone DHIS2 application: where users can configure, generate, and interact with scorecards independently.
- Embedded within DHIS2 dashboards: allowing scorecards to be combined with charts, tables, and maps for a more comprehensive view of performance.
- In review and accountability meetings: where scorecards serve as a central discussion tool to guide decision-making and action planning.
- As a monitoring tool: to regularly check progress against program goals, targets, or donor requirements.

## Advantages of the Scorecard App
The Scorecard App offers multiple benefits that strengthen performance management:
- Quick visual insights: Provides immediate snapshots of performance across indicators without needing deep analysis.
- Traffic-light color coding: Default colors (Red = poor performance, Yellow = average, Green = good performance) make it easy to spot strengths and weaknesses. Users can also customize colors to match program preferences.
- Trend observation: Allows users to monitor changes over time, helping detect improvements, stagnation, or declines.
- Comparability: Facilitates benchmarking across facilities, districts, or regions to highlight best performers and lagging areas.
- Action-oriented design: Directly links data to problem-solving, planning, and accountability mechanisms such as the Action Tracker App.
- User-friendly: Reduces reliance on advanced analytical expertise, making it accessible to a wider audience.
