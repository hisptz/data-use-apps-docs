# Features


The Scorecard App is designed to simplify performance monitoring in DHIS2 by providing flexible visualization, custom groupings, interactive dashboards/analysis, and sharing options. Below is a detailed breakdown of its core features:

## Intuitive Interactive Help
The scorecard app comes with built-in, interactive help features to guide users on how to navigate on specific module.
 - **What it does**: Provides on-screen help prompts, tooltips, and explanations for each page or module.
 - **How it works**: Users can click on **help icons** for detailed instructions as result reducing the need for external manuals.
 - **Why it matters**: Ensures that even new users can navigate and configure the scorecard independently, reducing training needs.

## Reusability Metadata from DHIS2 instance
The Scorecard App is built on DHIS2â€™s existing metadata like indicators, data elements and others, which means it integrates seamlessly with the Maintenance App.
 - **What it does**: Automatically pulls data from DHIS2 indicators, data elements and other metadata already defined in the DHIS2 instance.
 - **How it works**: When an indicator or metadata is updated in DHIS2, the change is reflected in the Scorecard App without requiring extra configuration.
 - **Why it matters**: This ensures that scorecards remain aligned with national standards and avoids duplication of work by leveraging already-approved metadata within the DHIS2 instance.

## Easy Scorecard Creation
The Scorecard app includes a guided setup wizard for creating new scorecards or manage it.
 - **What it does**: Provides step by step guidance during scorecard setup, from general description of scorecard to the setup of data sources or options for scorecard.
 - **How it works**: Users can configure general description of scorecard, data sources, thresholds, groupings, and others with the ability to save progress at each stage.
 - **Why it matters**: Reduces the complexity of configuration and ensures even users with limited technical knowledge can build scorecards.

## Custom Groupings
Indicators can be organized into custom domains or categories for thematic monitoring.
 - **What it does**: Groups indicators by health domain (e.g., Maternal Health, HIV, Immunization).
 - **How it works**: Users can create custom categories or use existing program structures.
 - **Why it matters**: Makes it easier to focus on priority areas and facilitates program-specific reviews (e.g., reproductive health scorecard vs immunization scorecard).

## Target Setting Support
Users can set custom performance targets for different organisational or operational contexts.
 - **What it does**: Allows setting of targets by time period, specific organisation unit, or entire organisational levels.
 - **How it works**: Targets are stored in the app and automatically compared against performance data to determine color coding.
 - **Why it matters**: Helps align performance monitoring with local goals and programmatic targets, providing context-specific analysis.

## Color Coded Analysis
The Scorecard app uses traffic light style color coding for quick performance interpretation.
 - **What it does**: Automatically applies color thresholds (<span style={{ color: "#FF0000" }}>**Red**</span>, <span style={{ color: "#FFFF00" }}>**Yellow**</span>, <span style={{ color: "#018000" }}>**Green**</span>) to indicator values based on defined targets.
 - **How it works**: Users can customize thresholds and colors to fit specific reporting needs (e.g., change cut-off points or add more levels).
 - **Why it matters**: Provides instant visual feedback, making it easy to identify underperforming areas and prioritize interventions.

## Scorecard into DHIS2 dashboard
The Scorecard App provides flexible and dynamic dashboards that allow users to present indicators in a variety of visual formats in the default DHIS2 Dashboard.
 - **What it does**: Users can display indicators as scorecards, tables, or charts in a Dashaboard.
 - **How it works**: The app applies intuitive color coding to instantly highlight performance levels, making dashboards highly visual and easy to interpret.
 - **Why it matters**: Scorecards can be embedded directly into the default DHIS2 Dashboard, allowing them to sit alongside other DHIS2 visualizations (such as pivot tables, maps, and charts). This enables users to compare scorecard results with other analytic outputs in one central location.

##  Indicator Tracking
The Scorecard app supports the tracking of unlimited indicators across health programs and organisational levels.
 - **What it does**: Monitors indicator values over time (monthly, quarterly, annually).
 - **How it works**: The app automatically aggregates results by periods and compares across facilities, districts, and regions.
 - **Why it matters**: Enables program managers and policymakers to see performance trends and quickly identify areas needing intervention.

## Flexible Filtering Options
The Scorecard app provides a wide range of filtering options to refine analysis.
 - **What it does**: Users can filter data by organisation units (facility, district, region, or groups) and time periods (relative or fixed).
 - **How it works**: Built-in DHIS2 orgunit and period selectors make it simple to drill down or aggregate results.
 - **Why it matters**: Gives users the flexibility to view performance at different levels and timeframes, supporting both routine monitoring and in-depth analysis.

##  Export & Share Data & Metadata
The Scorecard app includes multiple export and sharing functionalities.
 - **What it does**: Exports scorecard outputs in Excel, PDF, or CSV formats. Metadata can also be exported in JSON or CSV.
 - **How it works**: With a single click, users can download results or publish scorecards directly to DHIS2 dashboards.
 - **Why it matters**: Facilitates easy sharing with stakeholders, integration with other reporting systems like **ALMA**, and preparation of reports for meetings .
