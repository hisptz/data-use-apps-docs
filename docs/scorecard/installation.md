# Installation


## Install from DHIS2 App Hub


## Manual Upload


## Best Practices
### Upgrading to a newer version
- Always clear your browser cache to prevent conflicts between old cached files and the new version.
- Failure to clear cache may cause the app to fail to load or display outdated content.
### User permissions
- Ensure your DHIS2 account has App Management authority to install or update apps.
- Access to Scorecard application depends on user roles. Check under Users -> User Roles to grant or restrict access.
### Version compatibility:
- Verify that the Scorecard App version matches your DHIS2 instance version (e.g., v2.40+).
- Using an incompatible app version may lead to errors or missing features.
### Security considerations:
- Always download apps from trusted sources (DHIS2 App Hub ***or*** official [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/hisptz/scorecard-app/releases)).
- Avoid installing unverified packages to reduce risks of instability.
### Post-installation setup:
- Configure scorecard domains, indicators, and thresholds in collaboration with program teams.
- Save common configurations for reuse across review cycles.
- Test access with different user roles (e.g., facility staff, district managers) to ensure proper visibility.
