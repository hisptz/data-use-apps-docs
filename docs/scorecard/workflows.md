# Workflows

# Typical Workflows

The Scorecard App is designed to support a cycle of **Plan → Monitor → Review → Act**.
This ensures that data is not only collected but also used for decision-making.

---

## 1. Plan
- Identify key indicators that align with program goals.
- Group them into domains for structured monitoring (e.g., “Immunization Coverage”).
- Define targets and thresholds with clear traffic-light coding.
- Save scorecard configurations for routine use.

---

## 2. Monitor
- Apply filters for organisation units (district, facility), time periods, and indicator groups.
- Visualize results in scorecards, charts, or tables.
- Use display options to highlight trends and areas of interest.
- Refresh scorecards regularly to get the latest analytical outputs.

---

## 3. Review
- Use scorecards in quarterly or monthly review meetings.
- Interpret results using color-coded outputs:
  - Green = performing well.
  - Yellow = moderate concern.
  - Red = underperforming area requiring action.
- Compare across levels (district vs region) for benchmarking.

---

## 4. Act
- Document findings and action points from review meetings.
- Assign responsibilities to teams or individuals.
- Link to **Bottleneck Analysis (BNA)** to identify underlying causes.
- Track follow-up actions in the **Action Tracker** app.
- Revisit the same scorecard in future cycles to check progress.
