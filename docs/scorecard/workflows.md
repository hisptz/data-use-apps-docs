# Workflows

The Scorecard Application is designed to support a continuous cycle of **Plan** → **Monitor** → **Review** → **Act**, ensuring that data moves beyond passive collection to active decision-making, accountability, and follow-up. By embedding this workflow into routine program and health system management, the Scorecard App strengthens a culture of data use at all levels.

## Plan
The planning phase ensures that the scorecard reflects priorities and goals:
- **Define objectives:** Align key indicators with program priorities, strategic plans, or donor requirements.
- **Select indicators**: Choose a balanced mix of input, output, and outcome indicators for a holistic view of performance.
- **Organize indicators into domains:** Group related indicators (e.g., “Immunization Coverage,” “Maternal Health,” “HIV Services”) for clarity and focus.
- **Set targets and thresholds:** Define performance expectations using traffic-light coding (Green, Yellow, Red).
- **Customize configurations:** Build reusable scorecard templates for districts, facilities, or thematic areas.
- **Collaborate on design:** Engage stakeholders to ensure indicators are relevant and targets are realistic.

> **Outcome**: A configured scorecard ready for regular monitoring and aligned with program goals.


## Monitor
This stage focuses on real-time visualization and analysis:
- **Apply filters**: Narrow down by organisational unit (region, district, facility), time period, or indicator group.
- **Visualize performance**: Generate scorecards, charts, or tables to show trends and gaps.
- **Highlight key trends**: Use visual options (color codes, arrows, thresholds) to emphasize progress or slippage.
- **Regular updates**: Refresh scorecards to ensure that decisions are based on the latest data from DHIS2.
- **Data triangulation**: Compare scorecard outputs with other tools (dashboards, raw data, reports) for validation.

> **Outcome**: Evidence-based insights that can be shared with teams, managers, or partners.

## Review
The review phase embeds the scorecard into accountability and performance dialogue:
- **Routine review meetings**: Present scorecards in monthly, quarterly, or annual meetings.
- **Color coded** interpretation:
  - **Green** = Performing well; maintain momentum.
  - **Yellow** = Moderate concern; requires closer monitoring.
  - **Red** = Underperforming; immediate action needed.
- **Benchmarking**: Compare performance across districts, facilities, or regions to identify champions and lagging areas.
- **Equity analysis**: Use disaggregation (gender, age, geography) to highlight inequities in service delivery.
- **Collaborative problem-solving**: Facilitate discussions on root causes of underperformance.

> **Outcome**: Shared understanding of performance and priority areas for action.

## Act
The final phase ensures that data leads to concrete actions and accountability:
- **Document findings**: Capture meeting deliberations, recommendations, and agreed action points directly within the app.
- **Assign responsibilities**: Clearly allocate tasks to individuals, teams, or facilities with timelines.
- Integrate with other tools:
  - Link to the Bottleneck Analysis (BNA) app to identify systemic or operational barriers.
  - Connect with the Action Tracker app to log follow-up actions and monitor their completion.
- **Track progress**: In subsequent cycles, revisit the same scorecard to assess if interventions improved performance.
- **Promote accountability**: Ensure that follow-up is visible, reducing the risk of action points being forgotten.
> **Outcome**: Improved performance and service delivery, driven by a feedback loop of planning, monitoring, reviewing, and acting.
