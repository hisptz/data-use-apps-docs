User roles and permissions safeguard data by defining who can access, view, edit, or delete scorecards, while metadata maintenance ensures that scorecards remain accurate, relevant, and aligned with programmatic needs.

Additionally, the application provides migration tools to seamlessly transfer existing scorecards from earlier versions, ensuring continuity and usability.
