# Migrate Scorecard V1

If you have existing scorecards created using the older version of the Scorecard Application (V1), you can migrate them into the new Scorecard App for continued use. The migration tool is built into the application and allows you to transfer configurations seamlessly.

## Steps to Migrate Scorecards
- Open the Scorecard Application, then  at the bottom-right corner of the interface, you will see an option to Migrate from V1 to access page for inbuilt tools for scorecard migration.

- In migration page, list of available scorecards configured in the old Scorecard App will be displayed, then select the scorecard(s) you wish to migrate.
- Click the **`Migrate`** button and wait for the migration process to complete.
- Once migration is completed successfully, the migrated scorecard(s) will appear in the new Scorecard App, where they can be accessed and used as normal.

> **Note**: After migration, it is recommended to review the scorecard configurations including verify that indicators, filters, and other options are working as expected in the scorecard application.
