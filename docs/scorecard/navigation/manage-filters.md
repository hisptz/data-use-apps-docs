# Manage filters
The Scorecard provides flexible filtering options that allow users to refine data views beyond the defaults set during configuration. Filters can be applied at both Organisation Unit and Period levels, enabling more targeted analysis.


## Organisation Unit Filters
Even though default organisation units are set during configuration, users can adjust these selections when viewing a scorecard. Available categories include:
- **Organisation Unit Levels**: View data for specific levels such as Facility, District, or Region, based on access rights.
- **Organisation Unit Groups**: Analyse data by predefined groups of organisation units, for example, all facilities categorized as Dispensaries, Health Centres, or Hospitals.
- **Specific Organisation Units**: Select one or more units directly.
- **Relative Organisation Units**: Choose relative options like User Organisation Unit, User Sub-units, or User Sub-x2-units.

### Accessing Organisation Unit Filter:

- Select the preferred option(s) from the available categories of organisation units.
- Click **`Update`** to apply the filter. The scorecard will refresh to display data for the chosen organisation units.
