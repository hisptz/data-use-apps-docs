# Scorecard Analysis

The Scorecard App provides several analysis features to help users interpret data effectively, explore trends, and drill deeper into organisational and program performance.

## Visual Display and Target Ranges
Scorecards are displayed with color coded ranges based on what were defined during configuration of data for a specific scorecard. This makes it easier to quickly identify performance levels.

If Specific Targets have been set (by period, organisational unit, or organisational unit level), you can view them by clicking Specific Targets Library. This opens a panel with detailed definitions of those targets.

## Filtering Row
Use the Search bar to filter or trim rows when working with a long list of rows on a scorecard.

## Drill Up / Drill Down
Each row has an arrow icon at the beginning. Click this icon to expand (drill down) or collapse (drill up) data, allowing for both detailed and summarized analysis.

## Further Analysis Options

Right-click on any cell in the scorecard to open the More Options menu. This provides additional tools for in-depth exploration:
- Further Analysis: Opens a dedicated panel with the selected period and organisational units for deeper exploration.
- Lower Organisation Unit Levels: Analyzes the same indicator for lower-level organisational units under the currently selected unit (e.g., from region → district → facility).
- Trend Analysis: View trends for an indicator over time, with options including Last 3 months, Last 6 months, Last 12 months, Last 4 quarters and Last 5 years
