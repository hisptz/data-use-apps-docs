## Navigating the Scorecard

The Scorecard App offers simple and flexible navigation, enabling users to access scorecards directly from the DHIS2 app menu or from configured dashboards. Within the app, users can search, filter, and organize scorecards, switch between grid or list views, and perform key actions such as viewing, editing, or deleting based on permissions. These features ensure efficient access and management, supporting both routine monitoring and deeper analysis.
