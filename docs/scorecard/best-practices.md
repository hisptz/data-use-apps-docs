# Best Practices

To ensures that the Scorecard App is effectively adopted, reliably used, and embedded into routine program management, turning data into actionable insights, below are implementation tips and technical best practices.

### Start Small
- **Focus on priority indicators first**: Begin with a limited set of high priority indicators that reflect key program goals.
- **Gradual expansion**: As users become comfortable with the app, add additional indicators, domains, or organisation units.
- **Why it matters**: Reduces initial complexity and helps build user confidence in using the app effectively.

### Build Champions
- **Identify Champions**: Train a small group of enthusiastic users who understand scorecard functionality thoroughly.
- **Peer support**: These users can provide on the spot guidance, support review meetings, and mentor other staff.
- **Why it matters**: Champions help sustain adoption, accelerate onboarding, and create internal expertise.

### Integrate into Routine Reviews
- **Make scorecards part of standard review cycles**: Include them as standing items in monthly or quarterly program review meetings.
- **Action oriented discussions**: Encourage decision makers to focus on color coded insights to plan follow ups.
- **Why it matters**: Ensures that scorecards are used for decision making, not just reporting.

### Keep Configurations Updated
- **Review thresholds and domains regularly**: Update indicator targets, groupings, and color thresholds as program priorities evolve.
- **Retire outdated scorecards**: Remove or archive scorecards no longer relevant to avoid clutter.
- **Why it matters**: Maintains relevance and accuracy, keeping users focused on actionable insights.

### Foster a Data Use Culture
- **Encourage active use**: Promote using scorecards not only for reporting but also for planning, problem solving, and accountability.
- **Recognize improvements**: Highlight teams or facilities that demonstrate performance improvements via scorecard data.
- **Why it matters**: Builds a culture where data drives action, improving overall program performance.

### Use Built in Help
- **Interactive guidance**: Utilize the Scorecard Appâ€™s built in Help and tooltips to support new users.
- **Step by step onboarding**: New staff can navigate the app without extensive training.
- **Why it matters**: Reduces learning curve and enhances self-sufficiency among users.

### Technical Tips
- **Clear browser cache after updates**: Prevents conflicts with old files and ensures smooth functionality.
- **Optimize performance**: Use smaller scorecards (fewer indicators) for better responsiveness, especially in areas with slow internet.
- **Why it matters**: Ensures that the app loads quickly and performs reliably, improving the user experience.
