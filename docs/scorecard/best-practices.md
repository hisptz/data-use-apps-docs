# Best Practices

## Implementation Tips

For successful rollout and adoption of the Scorecard App, consider the following best practices:

---

## Start Small
- Begin with a limited number of high-priority indicators.
- Gradually expand as users become comfortable.

---

## Build Champions
- Train a small group of “power users” who can support others.
- Use them as resource persons in review meetings.

---

## Integrate into Routine Reviews
- Make scorecards a standing agenda item in monthly/quarterly reviews.
- Encourage decision-makers to act on color-coded insights.

---

## Keep Configurations Updated
- Regularly review and update indicator thresholds and domains.
- Retire outdated scorecards to keep lists relevant.

---

## Foster a Data-Use Culture
- Encourage teams to use scorecards not just for reporting but also for action planning.
- Recognize teams that demonstrate improvements through scorecard insights.

---

## Use Built-in Help
- The app provides **guided navigation** through the Help option.
- This is useful for quick onboarding of new users.

---

## Technical Tips
- Remind users to **clear cache** after updates.
- Encourage smaller scorecards (fewer indicators) for better performance on slow networks.
