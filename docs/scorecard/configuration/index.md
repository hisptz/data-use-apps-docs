# Configuration

## Scorecard Configuration
The Scorecard App configuration is a critical process that ensures the tool is aligned with organisational priorities and monitoring needs, ultimately enabling evidence based decision making. Configuration begins by defining key general information such as the scorecard title, description, and optional branding elements, as well as setting sharing permissions, default organisation units, reporting periods, and legends. These foundational elements establish clarity, usability, and consistency across all users.

Building on this foundation, users configure data by creating and managing groups of indicators, adding and organizing data items, and applying advanced settings such as weights, labels, targets, and custom legend ranges. This step ensures that the scorecard reflects accurate, relevant, and actionable information tailored to programmatic benchmarks/needs. To emphasize the most critical performance areas, users can highlight specific indicators, enabling decision makers to focus on trends and measures that require immediate attention.

The configuration process concludes with scorecard options, which allow customization of visibility and display settings. Users can choose whether to show legends, titles, averages, or hierarchies; apply filters to compare performance against averages; and configure display formats such as trend arrows or alternative table layouts. Saving options provide flexibility during the setup process whether saving and continuing, saving and exiting, or exiting without saving with confirmation prompts designed to safeguard progress.
