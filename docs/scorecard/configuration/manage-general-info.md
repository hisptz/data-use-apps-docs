# General Information

The general information configuration of a scorecard establishes the foundational settings that determine how the scorecard appears, who can access it, and how its data is displayed. Properly configuring these settings ensures that the scorecard is both user friendly and aligned with organisational standards or needs. Additionally it enables users to quickly interpret key performance indicators, focus on relevant organisation units and periods, and understand the significance of the data through clear legends. These configurations support consistency across users, enhance usability, and ensure that the scorecard serves as an effective tool for informed decision making, reporting, and performance monitoring.

## Scorecard Information
The scorecard’s primary information includes its title, subtitle, and description, which collectively provide context for the data presented. The title acts as the main identifier and should clearly convey the purpose of the scorecard. Subtitles are optional and can add clarification, specify the reporting scope, or indicate a theme. A description offers a more detailed narrative, explaining objectives, methodology, or the intended audience of the scorecard.

Additionally, a custom header can be applied to create a visually distinctive presentation, visible both on view a specific scorecaed and in downloaded scorecard in pdf format. This support allows inclusion of branding, logos, or other contextual elements, ensuring the scorecard is professional and informative in all formats.

## Sharing Settings
Sharing settings define who can access and interact with the scorecard. By default, all users are granted view and edit access. However, administrators can tailor the access to specific scorecard based on organisational needs. **No access** prevents a group of users from seeing or modifying the scorecard, ensuring confidentiality where needed. **View only** allows users to consult the data without making changes, which is useful for reporting or audit purposes. **View and edit** access grants users full capabilities, including modifying data, adjusting visualizations, and configuring scorecard settings. Properly configuring sharing settings balances accessibility with data security, supporting collaborative and controlled workflows.

## Default Organisation Unit
The scorecard can be configured to display data for a predefined organisational context. Users may set a specific organisation unit, such as a facility, district, or region, so that the scorecard automatically focuses on that organisation unit(s) upon opening. Alternatively, a relative organisation unit can dynamically adjust based on the user’s assigned unit. Configuration can also target a level (e.g., all facilities within a region) or a group of organisation units, providing consolidated views across multiple units. This ensures users immediately see data relevant to their roles, reducing manual filtering and improving efficiency in analysis and informed decision making.

## Period Configuration
Period settings control which time frames are displayed in the scorecard. Administrators can limit the scorecard to specific period types, such as monthly, quarterly, or yearly, preventing inappropriate comparisons across different time frames. A default period can also be specified, so the scorecard automatically opens with the most relevant period, such as the current quarter or year. These settings simplify user interaction, ensuring that users are presented with meaningful, actionable insights without needing to manually adjust time periods each time the scorecard is opened.

## Legend Definition
The legend provides a visual guide to interpret data values quickly and accurately. By default, a traffic light color scheme is used, where <span style={{ color: "#FF0000" }}>**Red**</span> indicates critical or underperforming metrics, <span style={{ color: "#FFFF00" }}>**Yellow**</span> signals caution or moderate performance, and <span style={{ color: "#018000" }}>**Green**</span> denotes satisfactory performance or target achievement. The legend also addresses no data scenarios and values outside defined boundaries, using distinct colors to make these conditions easily recognizable. A clear legend ensures consistent interpretation across users and supports informed decision-making based on the scorecard’s visual cues.
